## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Key things I learned: 

1: When using line height it is best to use a unitless number e.g 1.5 will multiply the elements font-size by 1.5 that will then be your line height. Good resource to learn more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height

2: When setting heights of an element always remeber the different between relative % or exact values like px, the element will always take the height of the content within it unless you specify a height, you can only use % if the height of the parent element has been set.  A good pen that demonstrates this: https://codepen.io/grayghostvisuals/pen/rJGBh. i will refrain from setting the heigt of elements when not necessary and adjust the content inside instead. 

3: Beware of breaking points! really think this true in your design process! It needs to look good at every point no matter how a person sizes the screen. 

### Continued Development

I need to make my style sheet neater and I need to label class and Id's better so its is more organised. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height) - To get a better understanding of how to use to use line heights 

- [Example resource 2](https://viewportsizer.com/what-is-my-screen-size/) - This is fanatstic to use when you want to know how big your screen is at that moment, so that you can design accordingly wiht the correct breaking points.

- [Example resource 2](https://codepen.io/grayghostvisuals/pen/rJGBh.) - A great pen that demonstarted the height of elements and nested elements
